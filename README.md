# Fetal-Health-XGBoost-Classifier
An online application built on Flask that classifies foetal health from CTG data as normal, suspicious, or pathological using the XGBoost algorithm.  It facilitates the early diagnosis of pregnancy problems with 96% accuracy.  Through an intuitive interface, users may register, log in, and receive forecasts.
# FetalHealth-XGBoost-Classifier

## üìå Project Overview

Pregnancy complications pose significant risks to maternal and fetal health, requiring early and accurate diagnosis. This project presents a Machine Learning-based approach using **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to classify fetal health based on **cardiotocography (CTG)** data.

With an achieved accuracy of **96%**, the model demonstrates significant potential in supporting medical professionals with timely and precise fetal health assessments.
